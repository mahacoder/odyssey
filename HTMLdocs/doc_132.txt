I am a Lecturer in the Department of Informatics of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.
I completed my Ph.D. in Information and Computer Science at UCI in 2006, with my dissertation entitled, "SimSE: A Software Engineering Simulation Environment for Software Process Education." I also hold an M.S. in Information and Computer Science from UCI, along with a B.S. in Biological Sciences, also from UCI.
