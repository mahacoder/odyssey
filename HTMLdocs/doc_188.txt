The Department aims to develop core strength in statistical theory and in the development of statistical methods. The Department has a strongly interdisciplinary flavor with existing collaborations in medical imaging, astrostatistics, and network topography. In addition, the department also includes six joint appointments from Economics, Public Health, Sociology and Computer Sciences. These faculty members contribute by serving as dissertation committee members for Statistics graduate students, collaborating in departmental research programs and teaching Statistics courses.
