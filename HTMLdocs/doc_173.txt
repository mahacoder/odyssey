	    About Me
        I am a big fan of Artificial Intelligence. I believe that one day robots will help the human in all our daily lives.
        I am currently a research scientist at Institute of Deep Learning, Baidu Research, working with Baidu Distinguished Scientist Wei Xu on Robot Learning. Previously, I worked with Jiang Wang, Chang
        Huang, Kai Yu, et. al. on Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Understanding.
	    I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at UC Irvine in 2013. I was a member of the Computational Vision Group where I was advised by Prof. Deva Ramanan and Prof. Charless Fowlkes. My research focuses on High Level Structured Image Understanding, particularly Object Detection, Semantic Image Segmentation and Articulated Human Pose Estimation.
        I had summer internships at Google and Microsoft Research. At Google, I worked with Emilio Antunez and Tianli Yu on Visual Clothing Search. At Microsoft Research, I worked with Simon Baker and Anitha Kannan on Proxemics Recognition. 
        I completed a master degree in Industrial Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with Prof. L. Jeff Hong, and a bachelor degree in Automation at Tsinghua University.
