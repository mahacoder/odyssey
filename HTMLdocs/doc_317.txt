		Congratulations to CML graduate students for recent poster awards at the 2017 Southern California Machine Learning Symposium held at USC.  Zhengli Zhao and Dheeru Dua (with advisor Sameer Singh) won best poster award for their work on generating natural adversarial examples and Eric Nalisnick (with advisor Padhraic Smyth) won honorable mention for his work on boosting variational inference. There were about 50 student posters presented and over 250 machine learning researchers attended the event. Next SoCal ML Symposium is scheduled for Fall 2018, to be hosted by UCLA.
