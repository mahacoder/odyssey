        My research is in computational vision, in particular how to integrate
        mechanisms for visual
        recognition and perceptual organization with
         3D scene understanding.
        We apply these computational models to a variety of problems including 
        development of tools for  biological image
        and shape analysis in neuroscience, animal development and
        palynology as well as applications to 
        forensic science.
