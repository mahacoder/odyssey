Â· February 8 Â· UCI InformaticsFebruary 8 Â· Judith Olson, Donald Bren Professor Emeritus of Information &amp; Computer Sciences, is among 83 new U.S.-based NAE members to be elected to the National Academy of... Engineering, one of the highest professional distinctions accorded to those pursuing research, education and applications in engineering and technical fields. Olson was commended for her leadership, technical innovations and development of systems that support collaborative work at a distance. Her specific research has focused on the impact of employees in remote locations, examining productivity, worker satisfaction and the challenges faced by supervisors.  She has also conducted intensive studies on the application of telepresence robots â€“ basically a tablet computer on a remotely operated scooter â€“ to enable students who are homebound due to illness to virtually attend classes at their schools. Olson is a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery and holds a lifetime achievement award from its Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction. "I am honored and delighted to be among so many amazing people elected to the NAE," she said. "The members here at UCI and around the world always strive for engineering and computer science solutions to make the world a better place." Congratulations, Judy Olson, on this well-deserved honor!

Â· February 5 Â· "Repairing Noisy Graphs" Abstract: Graphs are a flexible way to represent data in a variety of applications, with nodes representing domain-specific entities (e.g., records in record linkage, products and types in an ontology) and edges capturing a variety of relationships between these entities (e.g., an equivalence relationship between records in record linkage, a type-subtype relationship... between types in an ontology). Often, the edges in this graph are noisy, in that some edges are missing (i.e., real-world relationships that do not have corresponding edges in the graph) and some edges are spurious (i.e., edges in the graph that do not have corresponding real-world relationships). Directly analyzing noisy graphs can lead to undesirable outcomes, making it important to repair noisy graphs.  In this talk, we describe an approach that takes advantage of properties of real-world relationships and their estimated probabilities to ask oracle queries (an abstraction of crowdsourcing) to efficiently repair the noisy graphs. We illustrate this approach for the case of graphs that are unions of cliques (which is the case for record linkage) and graphs that are trees (which is the case for ontologies), and present theoretical and empirical results for these cases.

Â· January 30 Â· The Department of Computer Science is proud to present Xu Liu, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science, College of William and Mary. "Squeezing Software Performance via Eliminating Wasteful Memory Operations" Abstract:... Inefficiencies abound in complex, layered software. A variety of inefficiencies show up as wasteful memory operations, such as redundant or useless memory loads and stores. Aliasing, limited optimization scopes, and insensitivity to input and execution contexts act as severe deterrents to static program analysis. Microscopic observation of whole executions at instruction- and operand-level granularity breaks down abstractions and helps recognize redundancies that masquerade in complex programs. In this talk, I will describe various wasteful memory operations, which pervasively exist in modern software packages and expose great potential for optimization. I will discuss the design of a fine-grained instrumentation-based profiling framework that identifies wasteful operations in their contexts, which guides nontrivial performance improvement. Furthermore, I will show our recent improvement to the profiling framework by abandoning instrumentation, which reduces the runtime overhead from 10x to 3% on average. Speaker Bio: Xu Liu is an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at College of William and Mary. He obtained his Ph.D. from Rice University in 2014 and joined William and Mary in the same year. Prof. Liu works on several open-source profiling tools, which are world-widely used at universities, DOE national laboratories, and in industry. Prof. Liu has published a number of papers in high-quality venues. His papers received Best Paper Award at SC'15, ASPLOS'17 Highlights, and 2017 HiPEAC Paper Award.

Â· January 23 Â· Kameryn Denaro, Project Scientist, Teaching and Learning Research Center, University of California, Irvine. "Leveraging Statistics to Enhance Discipline-Based Education Research"  Effective analysis of "big data" in education research has the ...  potential to transform both research and practice, and has important applications for the already established field of Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER; NRC, 2012), a promising avenue for improving student performance and retention in STEM (GarcÃ­a-PeÃ±alvo et al., 2017). Additionally, to improve the quality of DBER we must draw on the expertise of data scientists and statisticians who are trained to study the complexities inherent in education research (Talanquer, 2014).In this presentation, two recent studies will be presented. The first study used change detection techniques to model student engagement in the learning management system (LMS); findings include that increases/decreases in activity with the LMS is related to student success. In the second study, the impact of supplemental instruction (SI) is examined using quantile regression methods. Finally, challenges and opportunities for the development of new statistical methodologies to enhance DBER will be discussed.
