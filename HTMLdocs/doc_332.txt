            Postdoctoral Researcher 
            Department of Computer Science 
            Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics 
            
            
            I study machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning with artificial neural networks. 
            
            
            My research includes a number of machine learning applications in the natural sciences, including the prediction of chemical reactions and data analysis for high-energy physics.
