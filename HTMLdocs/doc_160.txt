Shu Kong (Aimery) 


I am a computer science PhD candidate at Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, UC Irvine. I work at the Computational Vision Group where I am advised by Prof. Charless Fowlkes and working closely with Prof. Deva Ramanan. I am also collaborating with Prof. Olivier Cinquin, Prof. Surangi Punyasena and Prof. Zachary Pincus on several inter-disciplinary research projects.


My research is summarized as "Ubiquitous Fine-Grained Computer Vision". 
For example, rather than categorizing images or finding semantic segments, one can aspire to identify objects' specific sub-category within an entry level category and infer their precise geometrical layout in the image. Solving such fine-grained computer vision problems requires allocating great attention to details, and poses novel challenges and difficulties, 
whose solution will not only advance scientific understanding of vision algorithms, but also become increasingly important in developing intelligent robotic systems with broad societal impact and accelerating interdisciplinary scientific research.
An overview (but dated) of my research can be found in the one-page research statement.
